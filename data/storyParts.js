  tip:
    'While your natural instinct will be to give your CHARACTER a name like "George", to start you really want to define who your CHARACTER is. So instead of naming them. Tell us who they are I.E. "a Plumber", "a Teacher", "a Dad". The naming will come later.',

export const desireInfo = {
  title: "What is a desire?",
  tip:
    "DESIRE is what your CHARACTER wants. Here, your imagination is the limit. Does your CHARACTER want love, a promotion, or maybe she is looking for superpowers. You decide.",

  title: "What is an obstacle?",
  tip:
    "The OBSTACLE in your story is the thing that is keeping your CHARACTER from their DESIRE. It could be something as simple as shyness or as nefarious as the next great super villain. What is standing in the way of your CHARACTER?",

  tip:
    "Structure is the formula that your story will follow. While most writers don't like to be trapped by a set of rules, the truth is that rules and guidelines allow us to write better stories.",

  title: "What is the Story Statement?",
  tip: `The Story Statement is integral to your story. It is the one sentence that can answer the question "What is your story all about?" 
  <br/><br/>
  You build this sentence by combing your CHARACTER, it's DESIRE, and the OBSTACLE it must overcome.
  <br/><br/>
  I.E. "A teacher desperately wants to find love in her life but must first overcome her crippling shyness to do so."
